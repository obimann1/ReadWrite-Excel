# ReadWrite-Excel
Script to Read and Write to Excel Data files with .xlsx and .xls extensions
To be able to Read and Write Data to an excel file from a Selenium WebDriver script, we use the Apache POI library.
You can download the library from the Maven Repository or add it as a dependency to your Maven POM file.
This library allows you to read, create and edit Microsoft Office-documents using Selenium WebDriver commands.
The 2 excel data files (Data.xls and Data2.xlsx) are located on my local desktop computer.
